# Compute-Helper Demo

This is a demo project showcasing my Godot 4 [compute-helper](https://github.com/DevPoodle/compute-helper) plugin. It simulates slime mold in real-time. Inspired by Sebastian Lague's [Slime Simulation](https://github.com/SebLague/Slime-Simulation). Also check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A) he made on it.

## How to Use

You'll find all of the important scripts in the 'slime' folder. 'slime.gd' is the main script running the simulation. Each of the glsl files correspond to a shader used in the simulation. You can also find some less relevant code in 'slime-root.gd' and the 'utils' folder.

Hope this helps you on your journey to learn compute shaders!
